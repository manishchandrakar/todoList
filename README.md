1. **Create the Project**:

   If you haven't already created a new React project using `create-react-app`, you can do so by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app todo-app
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. **Organize the Files**:

   Organize your code as mentioned in the previous responses. Create the necessary folders (`src/components` and `src/styles`) and add the JavaScript files (`App.js`, `TodoList.js`, `TodoItem.js`, and `ResetButton.js`) as well as the CSS files (`App.css`, `TodoList.css`, `TodoItem.css`, and `ResetButton.css`).

3. **Create a README.md File**:

   In your project's root directory (`todo-app`), create a `README.md` file. You can create this file manually or use a code editor or command-line tool to create it. For example, you can use the `touch` command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   touch README.md
   ```

4. **Edit the README.md File**:

   Open the `README.md` file in a text editor and add the following content. You can customize the information to fit your project:

   ```markdown
